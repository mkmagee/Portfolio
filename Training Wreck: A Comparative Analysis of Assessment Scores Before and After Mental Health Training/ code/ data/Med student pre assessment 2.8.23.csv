MENTAL HEALTH CARE AND INTELLECTUAL AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES CURRICULUM FOR HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS


Dear Medical Trainee,



I am Andrea Caoili, Director of Research and Quality Assurance at the National Center for START Services. My team and I are conducting a research study to develop and evaluate the effectiveness of a training for medical students on working with individuals who have intellectual or developmental disabilities (IDD) and mental health concerns (IDD-MH). I am writing to invite you to participate in this study. 



This consent form describes the research study and helps you to decide if you want to participate. It provides important information about what you will be asked to do in the study, about the risks and benefits of participating in the study, and about your rights as a research participant. 
 


	 You should read the information in this document carefully, and ask me or the research personnel any questions, particularly if you do not understand something.
	You should not agree to participate until all your questions have been answered, or until you are sure that you want to. 
	This study will consist of viewing up to 6 hours of recording training during regularly scheduled didactic courses and completing pre- post- self-assessments and training evaluations. Each pre-post assessment will take up to 15-30 minutes to complete. 
	We are seeking up to 136 medical students to participate in this study. 
	You must be at least 18 years old to participate in this study. 




Taking part in this study is completely voluntary. You may choose not to take part at all. If you agree to participate, you may refuse to answer any question. If you change your mind, you may stop participating at any time. Any data collected as part of your participation will remain part of the study records If you decide not to participate or if you stop participating at any time, you will not be penalized or lose any benefits for which you would otherwise qualify. 



The benefit you receive from participating is increased knowledge and tools for treating patients with intellectual and developmental disabilities and mental health challenges. 



To help protect the confidentiality of your information, we will not ask you to identify your name when completing online surveys. Only the research team will have access to the data, and it will be analyzed and aggregated by the team. No third-party data processing will be required. We will report the data in aggregate and participants will not be named in the report. The results may be used in reports, presentations, and publications. 



If you have any questions about this research project or would like more information before, during, or after the study, you may contact Andrea Caoili at andrea.caoili@unh.edu. If you have questions about your rights as a research subject, you may contact Melissa McGee in UNH Research Integrity Services at 603-862-2005 or Melissa.McGee@unh.edu to discuss them. Thank you for your consideration.





Sincerely,
